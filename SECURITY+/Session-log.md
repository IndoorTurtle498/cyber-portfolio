## Session Log

### Session 1
- Date: 2/19/2026
- 10 bullets I recall:
  1. Certificates that are revoked can only be restored if they are put on hold
  2. Root CA's usually issue lower-level intermediate certificates
  3. Root CA's are usually offline to keep them secure
  4. Self-signed certificates aren't trusted
  5. Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is a protocol that reads and reports CRL's (Certificate Revokation List)
  6. CRL's are a master list of revoked/untruted certificates
  7. FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)
  8. A wildcard certificate takes care of Subdomains like *.github.com
  9. Code-signing certificate is for application
  10. SAN (Subject Alternative Name) allow for organizations to cover multiple domains with one certificate
