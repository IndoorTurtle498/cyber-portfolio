# Security+ Error Log

## How to use
Whenever I miss a question, I log it here. The goal is to reduce repeat misses.

## Miss Log

### Entry Template
- Date: 2/18/26
- Domain: 1.0 General Security Concepts
- Question topic (1 line): You have transferred an encrypted file across a network using the Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol. What happens to the file's encryption?
- Why I missed it (concept gap / trick wording / rushed / didn't know term): Concept gap
- Correct concept (2–4 lines, plain English): A file is automatically unencrypted when you copy it over a network using the SMB Protocol. The encryption does not carry over to the new location, nor does the file inherit from the new location. A file can be moved using the SMB Protocol.
- Cue to remember (1 line): Automatically unendrypted when using SMB
- Action step to lock it in (what I will do tomorrow for 5 minutes): Study SMB protocol behavior
