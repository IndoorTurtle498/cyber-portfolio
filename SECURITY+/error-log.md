## How to use
Whenever I miss a question, I log it here. The goal is to reduce repeat misses.

## Miss Log

### Entryies
- Date: 2/18/26
- Domain: 1.0 General Security Concepts
- Question topic (1 line): You have transferred an encrypted file across a network using the Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol. What happens to the file's encryption?
- Why I missed it (concept gap / trick wording / rushed / didn't know term): Concept gap
- Correct concept (2–4 lines, plain English): A file is automatically unencrypted when you copy it over a network using the SMB Protocol. The encryption does not carry over to the new location, nor does the file inherit from the new location. A file can be moved using the SMB Protocol.
- Cue to remember (1 line): Automatically unendrypted when using SMB
- Action step to lock it in (what I will do tomorrow for 5 minutes): Study SMB protocol behavior

- Domain: 1.0 General Security Concepts
- Question topic (1 line): Which of the following database encryption methods encrypts the entire database and all backups?
- Why I missed it (concept gap / trick wording / rushed / didn't know term): Concept gap
- Correct concept (2–4 lines, plain English): Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) encrypts the entire database and all backups. TDE: encrypts data at rest, which is data not being currently used. It's called transparent because when an authorized user needs to access the data, it is automatically decrypted so the user does not see the process or need to do anything extra.
- Cue to remember (1 line): TDE encrypts all
- Action step to lock it in (what I will do tomorrow for 5 minutes): Review TDE
